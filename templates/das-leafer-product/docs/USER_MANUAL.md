# Product Repo Manual

Audience

This manual is written for an intern who is new to multi-branch development and AI-assisted coding.

Prerequisites

- `dasops` is installed on your machine
- `codex` CLI is installed and authenticated

Core rule

Tooling and product repositories must be physically isolated.

If the tooling repo and the product repo share a folder, AI agents will eventually run the wrong code.

Section 1. Deterministic truth paths

Do not allow AI tools to invent new truth file locations.

The only allowed paths are:

- System truth
  - `docs/master_doc.md`
  - `docs/ui_spec.md`
- Change truth
  - `openspec/changes/<change-id>/master_doc_delta.md`
  - `openspec/changes/<change-id>/contracts_plan.md`
  - `openspec/changes/<change-id>/verification_plan.md`
  - `openspec/changes/<change-id>/tasks.md`
- Coordination locks
  - `openspec/changes/<change-id>/task_locks/<task-id>.lock`

If any new `tasks.md` appears outside these folders, treat it as a failure.

Section 2. Orchestrator workflow

Orchestrator owns the plan.

Orchestrator creates and maintains the change artifacts and the task plan.

Step 1. Create a change folder

```
dasops new-change --id add-login --intent "Add login"
```

If you want an automatic change id:

```
dasops new-change --id auto --intent "Add login"
```

Step 2. Use the Orchestrator prompt

Open this file and paste it into the Codex IDE agent chat.

`prompts/orchestrator.md`

Replace `{{CHANGE_ID}}` with your change id.

Step 3. Produce a stable tasks file

The tasks plan of record is:

`openspec/changes/<change-id>/tasks.md`

It must contain a single canonical task index table.

Task IDs are sequential and stable.

T-001, T-002, T-003.

Every task has a verify gate command.

Step 4. Assign owners

Orchestrator assigns owners in `tasks.md`.

Workers must not override an Orchestrator assignment.

Section 3. Worker workflow

Workers implement only the tasks assigned to them.

Step 1. Start a task

The safest intern flow is a single command.

```
export DASOPS_OWNER=worker01
dasops start-task --change-id add-login --task-id T-001
```

This creates a feature branch, creates a worktree, and claims the task lock.

Step 2. Run the Codex worker loop

Inside the worktree:

```
./scripts/run_worker_codex.sh add-login T-001 worker01
```

This renders `prompts/worker.md` and runs `codex exec --full-auto`.

Step 3. Complete the task

```
./scripts/verify
dasops complete-task --change-id add-login --task-id T-001

git add -A
git commit -m "T-001: <summary>"
git push -u origin HEAD
```

Open a pull request and let CI run the verify gates again.

Section 4. Git worktree basics

Worktrees let you check out multiple branches at the same time.

List worktrees

```
git worktree list
```

Remove a worktree

```
git worktree remove <path>
git worktree prune
```

Section 5. Cadence integration

Cadence provides deterministic verification and evidence artifacts.

Vendor Cadence

```
./scripts/install_cadence_vendor.sh --from-suite /path/to/DAS_TOOLS_v1_0_0/das-suite --tier oss
```

When using a standalone release package, `--from-suite` must point to
`<release-root>/das-suite`. Cadence is copied only from sibling release modules
such as `<release-root>/cadence-oss`, with Pro and Enterprise tiers using
`<release-root>/cadence-pro` and `<release-root>/cadence-enterprise`. The
installer fails if a requested tier is missing, if its signed
`release/vendor-identity.json` does not match the tooling lock, or if the
identity is not publication eligible. It does not replace an existing vendor
tree until the staged replacement has passed those checks.

For a local-only checkout that has not been published, use the explicit
development override outside CI and release profiles:

```
DAS_LEAFER_ALLOW_UNSAFE_VENDOR=1 ./scripts/install_cadence_vendor.sh --from-suite /path/to/local/das-suite --tier oss --unsafe-development-override
```

This records a `development-override` receipt and cannot satisfy a release
gate. `cadencew` accepts it only while the same local override environment
variable is present; it never uses a globally installed Cadence executable.

Run Cadence on this repo

```
./cadencew verify --profile dev
```

When Cadence is vendored under `vendor/cadence`, `./scripts/verify` also runs `./cadencew verify --profile dev`.

Evidence output is written to:

`.cadence/out/<run-id>/`

The latest alias is:

`.cadence/out/latest/`
